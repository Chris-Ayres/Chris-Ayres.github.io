Welcome to my page.I am a junior at the University of Notre Dame double majoring in Business Analytics and Economics with a supplemental major in Theology. From my first five semesters, I have experience using Python, R, SQL, Tableau, and Stata. Currently, I am searching for an internship for Summer 2024 with an MLB team in a Data Analysis role in order to begin a career working in baseball.
