Welcome to my page. I am a junior at the University of Notre Dame double majoring in Business Analytics and Economics with a supplemental major in Theology. From my course work, I have experience using Python, R, SQL, Tableau, PowerBI, and Stata. Currently, I am searching for an internship for Summer 2024 with a professional sport team in a Data Analysis role in order to begin a career working in sports.
