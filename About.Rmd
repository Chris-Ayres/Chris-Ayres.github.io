About Me
---

This website provides a look into some of the projects and baseball analysis that I have worked on throughout my time pursuing my degrees in Business Analytics and Economics.  I am a junior at the University of Notre Dame and currently seeking an internship for Summer 2024. I am initially from Collegeville, PA and have previously mentored with Patrick McFarlane from the Philadelphia Phillies to gain knowledge and skills in sports analytics and machine learning.
