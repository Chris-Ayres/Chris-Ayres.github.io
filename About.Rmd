About Me
---

This website provides a look into some of the projects and baseball analysis that I have worked on throughout my time pursuing my degrees in Business Analytics and Economics. I graduated from the University of Notre Dame in May 2025. I am currently a Redwoods Analyst at DaVita Kidney Care in Denver, Colorado. I am initially from Collegeville, Pennsylvania and have previously mentored with Patrick McFarlane from the Philadelphia Phillies to gain knowledge and skills in sports analytics and machine learning.
